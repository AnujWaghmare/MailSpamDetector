# Spam-Classification-Model-Application

## 📧 About the Project
This is a **Machine Learning application** built with Python and Streamlit that classifies emails as **spam** or **ham (not spam)**. It leverages a trained ML model to analyze text input and predict whether the email is spam or not.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Interactive User Interface**: Enter an email and instantly classify it as spam or not.
- **Streamlit-Powered**: Provides a seamless and responsive web interface.
- **Pre-Trained ML Model**: Uses a Naive Bayes classifier for efficient and accurate predictions.
- **Custom Vectorization**: Email text is preprocessed with a TF-IDF vectorizer to feed the model.
